      "Uzbekistan’s cities tell travelers captivating stories about the Golden Age of Islam and the Silk Road; when pioneering advancements in astrology, mathematics, and medicine took place. Bukhara is where Marco Polo’s father and uncle stayed for three years before moving to the court of the Mongol Khan, and where Avicenna wrote his teachings in medicine, while Samarkand was the capital of the Timurid empire. Marvelous mausoleums, gloriously decorated madrassas, and huge mosques will impress people of all ages. Travelers will feel immersed in the atmosphere of 1001 Nights, yet at the same time, one can explore the Soviet-built cities and visit the forbidden Soviet art expositions at the Savitsky Museum. The best time to travel is Spring and Autumn when temperatures are pleasant for evening tea and for interesting talks with hospitable locals about handicrafts, music, and culture.
